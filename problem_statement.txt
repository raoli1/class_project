Class project - Problem StatementRao Li (rl3427), Peilin Zhen (pz595@nyu.edu), and Maria Edwards (mae236)In the past 30 years, we have seen a lot of variation in housing prices in the US, from relatively stable prices in the 90s, through the housing bubble of the early 2000s and the following dip during the recession of 2008. In the coming decades, the US will see a growing population and a change in age demographics, as the median age increases as does the percentage of the population at retirement age. The country will also face unknown economic challenges as climate change, trade policies, the influence of technology, and other factors influence US GDP, median income and unemployment.In this project, we attempt to analyze how these changes might influence housing prices in the US by studying how they have done so in the past, in order to gain a stronger understanding of what is to come.
